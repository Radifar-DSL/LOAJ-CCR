# LOAJ-CCR
List of Open Access Journal for Computational Chemistry Research. Especially for publishing new software, prototype, dataset, and algorithm related to Computational Chemistry. 

## 1. [The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)

**Description** - The Journal of Open Source Software is a developer friendly, open access journal for research software packages.
  Committed to publishing quality research software with zero article processing charges or subscription fees.

**APC or Publishing Fee** - None

**Note** - Simple, beautiful, open-review (peer review using GitHub).

## 2. [PeerJ Physical Chemistry](https://peerj.com/physical-chemistry/)

**Description** - Scholarly publishing in Physical Chemistry today needs to be fast, rigorous, fair, and what the community wants. Our job is to give you the tools and service that you need to accelerate your field.

**APC or Publishing Fee** - Until now, June 23, 2020 it still free

**Note** - Fairly new

## 3. [Journal of Open Research Software (JORS)](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/)

**Description** - The Journal of Open Research Software (JORS) features peer reviewed Software Metapapers describing research software with high reuse potential. We are working with a number of specialist and institutional repositories to ensure that the associated software is professionally archived, preserved, and is openly available. Equally importantly, the software and the papers will be citable, and reuse will be tracked.

JORS also publishes full-length research papers that cover different aspects of creating, maintaining and evaluating open source research software. The aim of the section is to promote the dissemination of best practice and experience related to the development and maintenance of reusable, sustainable research software.

**APC or Publishing Fee** - £350 (Software Metapapers) or £400 (Issues in Research Software)
